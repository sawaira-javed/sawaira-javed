 Hi there, I’m @sawaira-javed!
I'm a passionate developer interested in exploring the world of technology and contributing to open-source projects.
 I’m currently learning machine learning and deep learning to enhance my skills in artificial intelligence and Flutter for cross-platform app development and honing my Python skills for various applications.
 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to AI, software development, or anything innovative that sparks my curiosity.
 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on GitHub @sawaira-javed or reach out via LinkedIn at [www.linkedin.com/in/sawaira-javed-8077a72b2].
⚡ Fun fact: I am also passionate about photography and love capturing moments in unique and creative ways!
